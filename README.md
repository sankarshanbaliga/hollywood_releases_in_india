Parts of this story have been published earlier as graphics in the Hindustan Times newspaper. You can read an expanded online version of the story [here](https://shijithpk.github.io/asian_games_athletics/index.html).

Most of the data for the story was taken from [IAAF.org](https://www.iaaf.org/records) and the [Athletics Federation of India](http://indianathletics.in/national-records).

The IAAF scoring tables used towards the end of the story are available [here](https://www.iaaf.org/news/iaaf-news/scoring-tables-2017).

You can find the python code used to scrape the webpages and analyse the data in this cleaned and commented up [jupyter notebook](notebook_cleaned_commented.ipynb).

Can't share all the data I used, that's the IAAF's, so I can't redistribute it. The github repo does have the final csvs though which I used to make the charts. They're in the 'data' folder.

If youâ€™re an econometrician, statistician or data scientist and think I should have done something differently in this analysis, do let me know! You can contact me on twitter at [@shijith](https://twitter.com/shijith) and by email at [mail@shijith.com](mailto:mail@shijith.com).
